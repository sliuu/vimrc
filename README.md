# vimrc
My .vimrc file because I &lt;3 vim

Heavily influenced by mj's colossal [vimrc](https://github.com/maxjacobson/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

My vimrc a few vim plugins, and you'll need a plugin manager to use them (but I don't think they're thaat necessary...) I use [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#usage) and it works fine.
